<p id="Par60">There are many examples of AI systems being funded, developed and deployed that are not fit for purpose, unethical, unfair, unsafe and further embedding discrimination in society. A key aspect of ethical AI is that of accountability and often the question is raised as to who should bear ultimate accountability and could potentially be held liable. It may be reasonable to predict that at some point, given the increasing number of challenged AI systems, that questions will be asked of those funding questionable projects. This is particularly relevant to funding using public funds and requirement to adhere to certain public standards.</p>
