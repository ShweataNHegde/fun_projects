<p id="Par75">Iris Bohnet in her book ‘What works: gender equality by design’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] explains that it is easier to change procedures than people and that over time perceptions and opinions will begin to evolve and accept new ways of working. The book highlights the ineffectiveness of unconscious bias training and also how other diversity solutions such as programmes to ‘encourage women’ can actually often just place an extra focus and work burden on women. Such programmes avoid the real structural issues that have resulted in their exclusion in the first place.
