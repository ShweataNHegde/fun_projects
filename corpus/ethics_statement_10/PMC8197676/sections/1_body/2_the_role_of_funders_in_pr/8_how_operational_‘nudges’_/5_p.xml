<p id="Par76">One well known example of a small procedural change that did have significant effect is that of “blind” auditions for orchestras. The general consensus pre-1970 was that men were better musicians than women and this explained the lack of representation of women in orchestras (only 5% were women). However, conducting auditions where the interviewers listened behind a screen, thus unaware of the gender of the musician, was effective in redressing this misconception and proved more effective than all unconscious bias training and mentoring in increasing the numbers of female musicians employed (to 35%). So, it is worth considering similar operational and system changes that can be introduced in the funding requirements that could begin to address the problems experienced regarding AI development. No one singular change is enough but each small ‘nudge’ when combined can produce great effect.</p>
