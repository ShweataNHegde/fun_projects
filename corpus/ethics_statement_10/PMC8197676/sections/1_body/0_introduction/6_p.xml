<p id="Par8">The Covid-19 pandemic has also resulted in many technological solutions and a very recent case has been highlighted with the QCovid living risk prediction algorithm used in the UK. This algorithm estimates risk of hospital admission and mortality from coronavirus 19 in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The algorithm used features such as age, ethnicity, deprivation, BMI and a range of comorbidities and had a sensitivity (number of correctly identified positives) of 75.7%. Commendably the authors did test their algorithm performance on men and women (still a rare occurrence) and found little difference. QCovid was used by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to determine who should have priority for the vaccine roll out. However, it has recently been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] by a JCVI committee member that the algorithm was likely to underestimate the risk to vulnerable people suffering from rare disease, particularly younger patients. The result being this group of patients, who are at high risk, were not prioritised for the vaccine. The committee member also pointed out that the datasets used to train the model may have other significant omissions due to some groups effectively shielding and not being exposed to the virus. Although this bias has not been verified it does reveal the importance of transparency and understanding of how such algorithms work if they are to be used to drive healthcare policy.
