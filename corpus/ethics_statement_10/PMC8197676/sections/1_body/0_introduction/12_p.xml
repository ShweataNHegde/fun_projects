<p id="Par15">One way in which we can encourage and ensure the development and deployment of Trustworthy AI systems is to influence public and charitable funding. Significant funding is awarded for AI projects and such grants are hotly sought after. The importance of public funds and investment for AI was addressed in the pivotal Hall-Presenti Review for the DCMS
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> and BEIS
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The report stressed the importance of public funds used to invest in major challenge areas (identified by Innovate UK and ESPRC) such as personalised and integrated health care. The report also highlighted key issues such as transparency, explainability, training and diversity. Though not expressly mentioned it would be fair to assume that such funding should be driven towards projects that are ethically designed to produce trustworthy AI solutions.
