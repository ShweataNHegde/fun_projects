<p id="Par19">Addressing the funding of AI systems may act as a significant nudge to require applicants to educate themselves in and apply Ethical/Trustworthy AI principles and design frameworks. Hence, in response to these issues we propose that grant funding and public tendering of AI systems should require a Trustworthy AI Statement within the grant proposal or tendering document. The statement would outline the actions planned by applicants to ensure their project and/or product can be deemed trustworthy and benchmarked against the rigorous standards.</p>
