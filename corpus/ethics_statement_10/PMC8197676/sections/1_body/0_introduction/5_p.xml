<p id="Par7">A well-known example is that of a health care risk-prediction algorithm used on more than 200 million US citizens to identify patients who would benefit from “high-risk care management program” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The aim of this management program is to provide chronically ill people specially trained nursing staff and extra primary-care visits. However, this algorithm demonstrated significant racial bias in that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than a White patient. The authors report that this bias reduced the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than a half. The reason this bias existed is because one of the features (or rules) the algorithm uses is that of health costs. This feature was used as a proxy for determining health need. However, due to unequal access to healthcare less money is spent on Black patients than equally sick White patients. In effect the algorithm was predicting health care costs not level of illness. The authors also showed that once this issue was noted and the algorithm modified to remove health costs the racial bias was eliminated.
