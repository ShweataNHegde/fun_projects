<p id="Par160">The purpose of this report is to address the continuing issues that have been seen due to AI being improperly developed and deployed, often leading to harm on individuals and society. We propose that funding bodies incorporate the requirement for trustworthy AI statements in their application procedure. This process will have a two-fold aim of educating funding applicants as to the importance and processes for developing Trustworthy AI systems and hopefully ensuring only those systems that have addressed issues such as bias for example are funded. We have outlined a simple structure and guidance of such a statement that could be modified to suit sector specific requirements.</p>
