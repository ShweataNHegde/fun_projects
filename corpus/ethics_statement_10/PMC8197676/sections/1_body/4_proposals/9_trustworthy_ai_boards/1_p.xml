   <p id="Par147">A high level independent board could provide guidance on policy, arising issues and maintain an overview of the guidance offered by the funding organization. A similar structure exists for example within the MRC with the Ethics, regulation and public involvement committee. Other examples of high level boards could be the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. There are pre-existing organisations that could adapt to a similar role or aid the establishment of such a body. Such a group could liaise with the Standards and regulatory organisations.</p>
