<p id="Par111">It should be stated that these proposals do assume that funders have a degree of accountability in terms of how they choose to direct funds, particularly if this is public money. Additionally, they also have the responsibility to provide the guidance and support to researchers to enable them to respond accordingly. This could be implemented by a simple change to current application forms and guidance (proposal 1), the presence of an AI ethicist on review panels, and/or the constitution of Ethical AI Boards, that could nudge the AI field effectively towards ethical development. Hence, proposal 2 sets out suggestions for funding bodies to consider as to how they would govern this aspect.</p>
