<p id="Par110">The proposals primarily address competitive academic funding calls but it should be noted that such calls often are responded to by joint academic, public sector and/or industry teams that have an intended route to impact. Therefore, we recommend that all R&amp;D funding calls relating to AI is subject to a specific trustworthiness assessment. This would take the form of describing how the proposal will address a stated ethical AI framework (either as required by the funding body or chosen by the applicants if not previously specified) and including details of their intended methods. This is outlined by proposal 1 by the insertion of a trustworthy AI statement section in application forms. It should be noted that although there are examples of ethics requirements by funding bodies that cover aspects of AI ethics principles, such as diversity and inclusion and data privacy, none are AI specific and address issues such as explainability of the entire AI system or fairness testing.</p>
