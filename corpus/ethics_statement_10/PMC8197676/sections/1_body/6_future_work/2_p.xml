<p id="Par158">Should a funding body choose to introduce the Trustworthy Statement (or a version of it) then it is proposed that the impact should be evaluated. Future research would entail a meta-analysis of the funding of AI projects prior to implementation of the statement and afterwards. This would determine if there were any substantive changes in the types of projects funded, the make-up of the research teams and styles of application. It would also pick out which features of the guidance are enacted, and which do not gain traction. As an adjunct to this it would be pertinent to survey current AI grant award panels for their own knowledge of Trustworthy AI requirements, views of current projects and application procedures and opinion ex-ante of the proposal. Post-hoc, it is proposed that applicants would be surveyed as to their own response to the requirement and how it altered, if at all, attitudes, plans and design of projects. Feedback from the funding organization itself would also be elicited in terms of how the ongoing monitoring of funded projects was managed and any issues therein.</p>
