<p id="Par53">As stated in the introduction the GDPR has not fully addressed the wider aspects of algorithmic systems, with its understandable focus on data privacy. However, the issues of automated decision making and profiling are mentioned and a number of articles and recitals do have applicability in terms of automated-decisions making (ADM) systems, including profiling. Relevant Articles that reference algorithmic systems directly are Articles 13, 14, 15 and 22. These Articles confer the right to be notified if subject to ADM ‘meaningful information about the logic involved’ including the significance and the envisaged consequences.</p>
