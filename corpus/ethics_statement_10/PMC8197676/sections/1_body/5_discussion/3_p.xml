This concern led to the development of proposal 2 which includes the utilisation of AI ethics experts as advisors in design of grant calls and on review panels. We also argue that though our proposals maybe seen as a ‘top down’ approach, particular with regards to proposal 2, there is the opportunity to inform and educate in both directions—requiring the grant review bodies and reviewers to understand the process as well as the applicants, who may indeed be the experts. This will therefore influence funders to consider the trustworthy aspects of their calls, to be cognizant of the risks and gather feedback to direct future investment in of AI that has endeavoured to be trustworthy.</p>
