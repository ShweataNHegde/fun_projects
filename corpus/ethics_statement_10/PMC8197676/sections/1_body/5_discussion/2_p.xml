<p id="Par149">The expectation is that the funding body will provide call specific guidance regarding the expected requirements for ethical design of the proposed AI systems. The funding body may choose to specify an ethical framework that is sector and/or country specific or allow free choice to the applicants to state the framework they intend to work towards. This allows for scaling of the proposal to wider national/international levels. By not specifying a rigid framework we allow for a flexible, adaptable solution that we believe provides a sustainable approach to governance.</p>
