<p id="Par148">The overall approach for proposal 1 is ‘Keep It Simple’ in that it asks for a short section of free text, as opposed to an extensive and complex checklist. This is a core strength as it means that the process is flexible, scalable and, crucially, easy to implement and assess for impact. It aids the applicant in terms of allowing project specific design and inclusion of risk matrices for example and avoids the need for a complicated, integrated approach to ensure that ethical adherence is highlighted in all work streams. Likewise, it also simplifies the review process for the review panel, particularly if specialists are not available. By collating the proposed methods for ensuring the project follows ethical AI principles in one statement it makes it easier for the reviewers to understand and check compliance with their requirements and guidance.</p>
