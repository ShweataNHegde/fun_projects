<p id="Par154">In the medium term we believe, as familiarity and acceptance increases, we would see the practice spread and more funding bodies to develop an established infrastructure of expertise and governance to support researchers. We view that proposal 2 will start to be developed at this point in individual funding organisations or even, if there were to be high level buy in, as a singular governing body akin to bioethics boards. We understand that there is a significant cost implication for the development of proposal 2. However, there are in existence several organisations that can offer support and help design frameworks and formation of governance and advisory boards (e.g. in the UK there is the Ada Lovelace Institute, Turing Institute and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation). Hence, in the medium term we feel the impact could be that more calls would enact the proposals and the process begins to become an accepted norm and a backbone of ethical support is provided for both funding bodies and researchers.</p>
