<p id="Par152">Should a grant funder opt to implement proposal 1 we anticipate that the short-term implication will be an adjustment in the focus of the proposals put forward to meaningfully attempt to address ethics-by design. It will also alter the discussions and grading of grant proposals and potentially direct funding to projects that aim to be ethical and sustainable. This low cost, easy to implement proposal may indeed be as far as the proposals develop, which is a risk. Another concern is that the proposal could become opaque enough that it risks ‘ethics-washing’ proposals. However, we do feel that even this alone will at least enable auditable trails to be created as well as points of reflection and that in the longer-term this could become less of an issue as governance and tools are refined.</p>
