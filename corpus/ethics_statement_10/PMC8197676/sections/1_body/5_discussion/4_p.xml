<p id="Par151">Likewise, there is a limitation in terms of applicants who are not fully informed of the principles for ‘ethics-by-design’ and for organisations ethics panels, as is standard in universities and growing in industry, to also fully understand these principles alongside their RRI (responsible research and innovation) frameworks. We recognise that this maybe a difficult hurdle but it is also a core reason why the proposals have been posited. It is hard to educate people who are unaware of the need or value of adhering to such principles. With regards to university ethics boards this is an area that universities will need to consider in their ethical approval and However, it is normal in developing a grant call to collate a team of experts that can either take responsibility of set work packages e.g. ethical governance and stakeholder engagement, in much the same way health calls have nominated PPIE leads. Likewise, organisation ethics boards can also utilise such expert support, as is currently the practise for example with EDI involvement. Hence, we feel this is not an insurmountable obstacle and that by focussing on the funding stream the proposals offer a driver for faster adoption of ethics-by-design approaches outside of any regulatory requirements that maybe forthcoming.</p>
