<p id="Par104">As an outcome of the Ethics Review a number of Ethics Requirements and an Ethics Work Package is produced. There are two types of Requirement, those for the grant preparation and then for the ongoing project. The Requirements are included in the grant agreement as project ethics deliverables which are also placed in the work package. If the project breaches the ethics principles an Ethics Audit can occur. Audits can result in changes to the grant agreement and possibly reduction or termination of the grant arrangement.</p>
