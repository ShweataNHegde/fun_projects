<p id="Par87">As this grant is a broad-based grant it also has a section for applicants to outline the Research Governance and Ethics for the project. This section is subdivided into 3 parts. Firstly, they require an outline of how applicants will ensure the activity will be carried out to the highest standards of ethics and research integrity (2000-characters). Secondly, applicants are requested to outline the potential ethical, health and safety issues (2000-characters). Finally, a sub-section asks if any of the proposed research involves human participation, human tissue, patient/participant data, animal research, genetic and biological risk, arms/military research (including dual-use technologies). If the project does involve any of these aspects, then applicants are required to confirm they have obtained the necessary permission certificates.</p>
