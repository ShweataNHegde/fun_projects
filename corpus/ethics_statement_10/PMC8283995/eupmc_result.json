In March 2016 a questionnaire study was conducted among 279 pupils (mean age 13.1\u00a0years) of a secondary school in northern Germany.<h4>Results</h4>A majority of participants showed a general good understanding of foundational research ethics concepts as understood from the AKEK consent form.

Own health concerns and pro-social considerations were found to be significant motivational factors for participating in research, while anticipation of pain lessens likelihood of participation.
