 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics include mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) as well as minimum (MIN) and maximum (MAX) values. For categorical and ordinal variables, frequencies and percentages for each category are displayed within contingency tables. For associations between categorical variables, Spearman’s rank correlation was used. To assess the statistical significance between proportions, non-parametric tests were used as appropriate to item scale characteristics, including χ
 <sup>2</sup> test, Fisher’s exact test and the Mann–Whitney U test.
