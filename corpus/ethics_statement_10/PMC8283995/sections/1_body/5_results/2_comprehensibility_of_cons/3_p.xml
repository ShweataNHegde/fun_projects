<p id="Par33">When asked about specific topics explained in the consent-form, a majority (averaging 88.11% through all age groups) correctly answered four of the five questions regarding: the final decision maker (80.29%, N = 224), the overall trial purpose (95.34%, N = 266), the right to withdraw (89.96%, N = 251) and the mode of placebo/drug allocation (84.23%, N = 235). By contrast, when asked about someone’s personal gain from study participation (according to the consent form) the answers were more divided, with most (57.75%, N = 161) believing that receiving the study medication will help them get better and 32.95% (N = 92) choosing “I have no personal benefit from study participation”, which was intended to represent the correct option.</p>
