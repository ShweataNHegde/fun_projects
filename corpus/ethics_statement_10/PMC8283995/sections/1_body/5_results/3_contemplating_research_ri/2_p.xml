<p id="Par35">To investigate whether trial participation is perceived as being aimed at a study participant’s individual benefit, we posed two statements that required true/false answers. The first statement claimed that study participants will always receive the best possible treatment, which was disagreed with by 67.03% (N = 187). The second statement proposed that clinical trials are undertaken to improve participants’ health, and received almost equal amounts of agreement (48.75%, N = 136) and disagreement (47.67%, N = 133). When checking for overlap between those who agreed with either, neither or both statements, 35.84% (N = 100) of participants were found to disagree with both statements, 17.92% (N = 50) confirmed both statements and 41.94% agreed with only one of the statements (30.11% (N = 84) agreement statement one/disagreement statement two, 11.83% (N = 33) vice versa).</p>
