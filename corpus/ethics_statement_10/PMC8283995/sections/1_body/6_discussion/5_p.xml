<p id="Par46">Earlier qualitative work on potentially determining factors in childrenâ€™s willingness to participate in research has implied that personal benefit [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and advice from trusted others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] are strong influences. Our study substantiates this with statistically significant findings for a large group of adolescents. This is in line with findings in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We also detected a distinct difference between older and younger adolescents, with the former more likely to agree to research participation if an incentive was offered, and the latter more inclined towards it if their parents or their doctors advised in favour. While both factors may indeed influence the decision-making process (for incentive see e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]), in our data incentives were not among the 7 strongest motivators for participation in research in any age group. Further research is needed to determine their relevance in different age groups.
