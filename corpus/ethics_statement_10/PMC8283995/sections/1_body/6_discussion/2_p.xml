<p id="Par43">Pioneering work by Ondrusek et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] indicated that children younger than nine years old are likely to lack sufficient understanding to be able to assent. Tait et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] found that understanding significantly improved after the age of 11. These findings were substantiated quantitatively using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research (MacCAT-CR), demonstrating that adolescents from the age of 11.2Â years are likely to be sufficiently competent to consent to research participation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our findings support this. Most of the 10- to 16-year-old participants in our study were capable of comprehending and correctly answering questions regarding their right to decide about their hypothetical study participation, their right to withdraw from study particpation, the overall purpose of the study to test a new medicine and the random allocation of placebo/treatment as understood from the consent-form.
