 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, combining the established consent-process with supplementary tools (e.g. multimedia, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) is currently considered as a supportive measure. As the ability to successfully differentiate between research and treatment may, at its core, be related to conflicting cognitive frames, as suggested by Lidz et al. [
