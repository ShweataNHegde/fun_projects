<p id="Par14">As one’s ability to give informed consent is, by definition, dependent on one’s ability to understand the subject matter at hand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], children under a certain developmental age are unable to give fully informed consent, i.e. make a legally binding decision. Therefore, parents are required to give consent in their children’s stead considering not only their wellbeing, but also their presumed wishes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As children advance in age, most appreciate increased involvement in the medical decision-making process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Their right to be involved is undisputed both ethically and legally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but the legal age at which an adolescent is deemed able to give consent differs considerably within the EU [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], ranging from 14 to 18 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is, however, consensus as to the minimal requirements of paediatric decision-making: a minor’s assent (non-legal agreement) to research participation or treatment must be gained in addition to their parents’ consent, and their dissent (disagreement) must be taken into account when reaching a final decision [
