<p id="Par54">Bearing in mind adolescentsâ€™ generally good understanding (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), we infer the lack of knowledge about medical research in general to be one source of therapeutic misconception. As understanding may improve further when the consent-process is temporally spaced out (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]) we propose a multi-staged approach whereby general research education is ideally completed before an individual becomes a patient or potential participant. Placing general research education before patient specific consent-processes disconnects knowledge about characteristics of research from the actual project and may eventually improve the quality of consent.
