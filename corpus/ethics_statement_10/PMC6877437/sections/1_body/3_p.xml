<p>On page 148, the ethics statement in the last paragraph should read “Anonymous case reports are exempt category reviews by the institutional review board (IRB) at Albany Medical Center, Albany, NY, USA. The IRB does not require consent of the patient for an anonymous case review. Therefore, a formal IRB consent waiver was not required and was not obtained. Our study follows the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.”</p>
