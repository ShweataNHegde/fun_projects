 </sup> During COVID-19, people were required to refrain from going out, so domestic violence in the home increased, and the number of consultations seen at the Public Spousal Violence Counselling Support Center increased by 1.3 in April 2020 compared to April 2019, although there has been some stabilisation since, with no differences between July and September 2020 and the same period in 2019.
