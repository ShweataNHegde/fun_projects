<p>The success of Domestic Violence Consultation Plus during COVID-19 is related to the interconnection of the All Japan Womenâ€™s Shelter Network with numerous shelters across Japan, allowing access even to those in remote areas. This has the potential to be an excellent safety measure for domestic violence survivors especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite four telephone lines being currently in operation 24 hours a day, expansion is needed, as, for example, the current connection rate is only 20%, leaving 80% of survivors waiting to be connected. Additional government funds will be needed for the extra operating costs. Fortunately, in September 2020, the Cabinet Office agreed to allocate a further US$3.6 million for Domestic Violence Consultation Plus.
