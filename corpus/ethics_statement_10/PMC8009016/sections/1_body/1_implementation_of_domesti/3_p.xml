<p>In addition to the above effects, the interviews also revealed how private shelters were operated. Old mansion apartments and regular apartments are rented and used as single-family units. People in the facilities had to use disinfectants, wear a mask, and refrain from going out unnecessarily. The average length of stay in these private shelters is approximately 50 days. Shelter staff said they had concerns about deadlines and given the spread of the pandemic, wondered when people would have to be told they had to leave the shelter. We were told that arrangements were different in public shelters. People were not allowed to leave their rooms for a week (because of COVID-19 cases), and staff members wearing protective clothing placed food trays in front of rooms to avoid contact. Many public shelters are equipped with shared baths and toilets, and none of the rooms are private, making these facilities difficult to manage during the pandemic.</p>
