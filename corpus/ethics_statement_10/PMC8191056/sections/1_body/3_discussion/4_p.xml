<p id="Par58">Enabling open access to identifiable genomic data i.e., without user authentication or registration as a condition for access, runs counter to extant evidence from public opinion studies and data protection regulation. Our study too supports this conclusion. No panelist argued that access to anonymized or coded data should be barred categorically. Panelists disagreed, however, on the appropriate standards that should be applied when determining whether access (open or controlled) to the child’s genomic data (anonymized or coded) advances children’s best interests. Although a clinical best interest standard was considered too high, especially for sharing data in the research setting, clinician-scientists and bioethics researchers were more likely than REB members to factor in the prospect of ancillary benefits to diagnosis for individual patients (Statement #7). Our observation has important implications for clinicians working in genomics-enabled learning health systems whereby clinical and research data sharing are seamlessly merged to support precision diagnosis, care and treatment [
