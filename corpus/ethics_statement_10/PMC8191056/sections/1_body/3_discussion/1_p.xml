<p id="Par55">Nine original statements from the KIDS Framework, and one new statement were validated in this three-round policy Delphi study with pediatric genomic stakeholders in Canada. The three highest ranked statements corresponded to essential elements in the informed consent process, namely evaluation of realistic risk and benefit (Statement #8), transparency about how data will be managed and used (Statement #3), and the possibility of future unspecified use (Statement #5). Lack of consensus and high polarity with respect to Statements #10–12 centered on the relationship between re-identifiability risks, and how access to anonymized and coded genomic data should be managed. The conceptual difficulty and high comprehension level needed to participate meaningfully in shared decision making were likely reasons Statement #2 ranked low despite wider support in the pediatric bioethics literature for children’s engagement in research decisions. The impossibility of withdrawing research data if already aggregated, and an inability to provide a “menu” of data sharing options to accommodate family values likely explain why Statements #4 and 8 ranked among the lowest relative to other Statements.</p>
