<p id="Par56">Highly polarizing views on the effectiveness with which genomic data could be anonymized prevented consensus on Statements #10 and #11. The same ethics principles were at times used by different stakeholders to simultaneously oppose and support open access sharing of anonymized genomic data. This trend was particularly apparent between clinician-scientists and REB members. Many panelists were conflicted about the acceptable level of informational risks to children, the scope of parental authority to share their child’s genomic data indefinitely, and children’s inability to exercise full decision-making with respect to the access and sharing of their data once reaching the age of majority. Our findings corroborate other studies that report opposition from REB Chairs/members to open access for anonymized genomic data (see for example 26–28). In our study, panelists who served on REB petitioned for stricter user authentications and data access controls than what are currently required in applicable clinical and research data protection regulations.</p>
