<p id="Par59">Qualitative responses from panelists across all survey rounds suggest that stakeholders appeal to three key considerations for sharing childrenâ€™s genomic data: (i) the re-identifiability of the data being shared, (ii) that access to the data is appropriate to the risk of re-identifiability, and (iii) adequate oversight of approved uses for the data. Several conclusions may be drawn from this observed relationship. First, recommended data access regimes may be unlikely to obtain stakeholder buy-in until sufficient evidence demonstrates the actual risk of re-identifiability from anonymized genomic data sets, and this evidence can be communicated to guide shared decision making. Second, general skepticism of data anonymization underscored tensions between data sharing practitioners e.g., researchers and clinicians and oversight bodies e.g. IRBs and DACs. Both groups reinforced that IRBs should have additional training in the review and oversight of protocols that involve consenting families on the realistic benefits and risks of genomic data sharing.</p>
