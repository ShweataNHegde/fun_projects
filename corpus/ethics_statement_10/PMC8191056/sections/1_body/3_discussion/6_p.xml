<p id="Par60">Further research is needed to assess this relationship across diverse data sharing contexts, patient populations, jurisdictions and data repositories. In specific, research quantifying the relative informational risks posed to patients and their families when their genomic data are shared is needed if the intractable views surrounding access and governance highlighted in this study are to be resolved. A case-by-case privacy test as part of an institution’s data sharing policy provides one possible approach to better contextualizing the benefits and more proportionately assess the informational risks of an anticipated data sharing activity for children and their families.

Consultation with patients—children if possible and appropriate, as well adult patients—is critical in this regard to ensure an institution’s data sharing policy aligns with the values and priorities of the community it serves.
