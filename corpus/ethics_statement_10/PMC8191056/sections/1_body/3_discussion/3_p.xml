Rather, “the significant risk is related to lack of data sharing when it comes to children and slowing the field of research” (Psbg4). It is likely that the overall skepticism expressed in relation to Statements #10 and #11 prevented validation of Statement #12. Implicit in the arguments from panelists with a bioethics background, in particular, was that REBs lack confidence in researchers’ ability to anonymize, or otherwise keep secure children’s genomic data before promoting data sharing opportunities to the extent that Statement #12 endorsed. Despite changes to the panel’s composition between Rounds 2 and 3, the statistical measures of consensus and polarization varied marginally from Round 1. The content analysis furthermore revealed few perceptible differences between early career and senior panelists for Statements that failed to reach consensus.</p>
