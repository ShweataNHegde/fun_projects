<p id="Par14">A mixed methods policy Delphi design was used to evaluate 12 individual policy statements of the KIDS Framework from the perspectives of Canadian pediatricians, genomic researchers, IRB chairs and pediatric bioethicists. First proposed by Turoff in 1970, the policy Delphi is an “organized method for correlating views and information pertaining to a specific policy area and for allowing the respondents representing such views and information the opportunity to react to and assess differing viewpoints” [

Through a controlled input and feedback process using closed surveys, select experts in a Delphi panel (i) formulate the policy issue, (ii) explore policy options, (iii) determine initial positions, (iv) evaluate underlying reasons for these positions, and finally (v) re-evaluate policy options. The policy issue was first formulated, and initial policy options determined (phases i-iii) based on an earlier systematic review of the literature and consensus committee workshop [
