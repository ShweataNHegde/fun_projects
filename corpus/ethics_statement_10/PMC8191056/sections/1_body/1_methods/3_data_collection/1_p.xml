<p id="Par22">All Delphi survey data were collected online using LimeSurvey between January and October 2018. Panelists were allotted 2 weeks to complete each Delphi Round, and a follow up email reminder was sent on the 3rd week. Panelists also remained anonymous to each other throughout the study to ensure confidentiality, enable independent rating and reduce undue influences namely between junior and more senior panelists. Panelists could also modify their answers at any time using a unique survey token. An informational landing page preceded each survey round whereby panelists agreed to participate prior to launching the online survey to ensure an ongoing consent process. Between three and five project-naïve individuals piloted each round of surveys for comprehension, format and clarity prior to distribution. The first author managed data collection and analysis. The authors have combined training in genomic science, biomedical ethics—with a special focus on issues of genetics/genomics involving pediatric populations in Canada—as well as knowledge translation. Many panelists had previous collaborated on, or were familiar with the authors’ work in these areas, enhancing participant trust in the research team.</p>
