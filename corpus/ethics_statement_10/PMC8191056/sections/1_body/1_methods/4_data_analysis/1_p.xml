<p id="Par23">A classification system according to consensus ranking, polarity and support was used to assess ratings for 12 individual statements from the KIDS Framework. Panelists used a 4-point Likert scale to rate each statement on two of four categories—relative importance, feasibility, desirability or confidence—with 1 indicating most, and 4 indicating least important, feasibile, desirable and confident [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Mean and inter-quartile range were calculated from Likert ratings to determine the (i) degree of consensus and (ii) strength of polarity. Recommended thresholds for consensus—high, moderate, and low—and polarity—strong, weak and none—were established from the published Delphi literature [

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. This quantitative data was triangulated with written, qualitative responses Delphi panelists were required to provide to justify their ratings. The supplemental rationales were then analyzed using content analysis [
