 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] together with content analyses of rationales were used to determined “whether the group supported, opposed, or was ambivalent towards an option; whether the group was split…or whether no clear picture of support emerged” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] for statements outlined in the KIDS Framework. Statements were validated if the combined ratings and qualitative responses indicated high consensus, low to no polarity and at least weak support. Panelists accessed a summary of how their ratings and responses from the previous round compared to the group. Statements indicating low consensus, high polarity or strong- to weak opposition were retained for re-rating and review in the subsequent round. All descriptive statistics and line-by-line qualitative coding were conducted in Microsoft Excel behind a password-protected server. Every survey concluded with the option to submit open-ended feedback on amending, eliminating or adding new statements.
