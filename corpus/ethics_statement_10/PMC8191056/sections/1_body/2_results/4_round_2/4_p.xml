<p id="Par35">Both statistical and content analysis of the rationales for amendments to Statements #10–12 yielded mixed results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Panelists who advocated for eliminating Statement #10, for example, argued that “true anonymization is a myth” (Pgw85), the informational risks associated with re-identification of data derived from genetic testing are too high “even with today’s technology” (8OYZ) and IRBs requires additional resources to ensure adequate data protection. One panelist underscored the fact that “Children are vulnerable and typically won’t be making this decision for themselves” to justify why public access to anonymized data should be discouraged. In contrast, one proponent justified their support for preserving Statement #10 by arguing that there should not be a separate risk threshold for children and adults:

  <p id="Par36">I do not believe the risks to children in collecting and making available data (with protections considered adequate for adults) are unreasonable or that the level of risk alone would justify restricting its use. What is at issue probably stems more from a concern about the developing autonomy of children and the worry that choices might be made regarding data sharing that would not reflect the future adult’s preferences. However, we permit use of anonymized data without consent (sometimes even without REB review) for adults. I don’t think we can base this argument on level of risk (in the data sharing context) when we permit such practices for adults—Pa7KH.</p>
