<p id="Par39">Votes to amend Statement #11 were evenly split (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and panelists proposed three different access approaches for sharing coded genomic data i.e. de-identified data with a source key. Of those panelists who disagreed with both the original and amended Statement #11, most believed that recommending controlled access to coded data was premature given “the risks have not been well enough established.” Two panelists argued in favor of more stringent user authentication for controlled access to coded data, while another panelist suggested registered access was both a more efficient and economically viable option insofar as it ensures “robustness of the applicant authentication process”. The majority of panelists agreed that controlled access conferred an appropriate degree of security for coded genomic data, and contended that stricter access controls are counterproductive: “this is about not overprotecting children and delaying research” (PSbg4).
