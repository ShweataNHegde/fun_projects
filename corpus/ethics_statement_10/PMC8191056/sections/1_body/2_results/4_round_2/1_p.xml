 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the composite ratings from both Rounds 1 and 2. An inter-round comparison of the degree and direction of change between Rounds 1 and 2 were also calculated and are presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. New ratings in Round 2 decreased on average 2.2 points, indicating heightened valuations of relative importance, feasibility and desirability after panelists reviewed results from Round 1. An amendment to Statement #7, as well as the addition of Statement #13 were both approved based on simple majority (Table
