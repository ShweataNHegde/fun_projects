<p id="Par61">The results of this study should be interpreted in light of several limitations. The panel size was within the 10–50 range recommended in the policy Delphi literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], yet response rates were lower than those reported in similar studies (~ 25%). Consensus among this panel may not therefore suggest how well the KIDS Framework may transfer across other pediatric genomic centers in Canada. This study does not capture the views and perspectives of all interested stakeholders in pediatric genomics. Because the study aimed to validate a framework meant to guide institutional data sharing policy and practice, only institutional stakeholders were recruited to participate on the policy Delphi panel. Input from pediatric patients and their parents is missing from this validation exercise, albeit critical to the future implementation of the KIDS Framework. To reduce survey fatigue and ensure retention among panelists, the study team assigned two, rather than all four possible rating criteria for each statement. Rating assignments were informed by findings from a systematic review of the data sharing literature, but could have narrowed the strength and direction of consensus. While many Delphi studies suffer from high attrition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], this study achieved higher than usual retention (&gt; 90%). It is possible, however, that inconsistency in the panel’s composition between Rounds 2 and 3 influenced consensus outcomes, particularly involving the most contentious Statements #10–12.
