<p id="Par62">The ten validated statements provide institutions with empirically supported best practices for sharing genomic and associated clinical data involving children from the perspectives of key stakeholders in pediatric genomics in Canada. The qualitative and quantitative results from this Delphi study identify for institutions and policy makers where contentious areas still lie in the evolving debate on responsible data sharing, namely establishing data access and oversight regimes commensurate with the relative informational risks of sharing sensitive, genomic information. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, first to contribute such empirical policy evidence in Canada. Moreover, this study demonstrates how the policy Delphi is a particularly useful tool for mixed methods researchers that aim to identify key ethical, legal and social issues relevant to genomic data governance, and to capture the normative stalemates preventing broader consensus among interested stakeholders. Future implementation science research in this area is needed that involves more diverse stakeholders across clinical and research data environments, notably pediatric patients, their families, data privacy engineers, genomic data custodians and database managers.</p>
